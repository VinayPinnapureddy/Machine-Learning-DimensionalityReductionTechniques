# Machine-Learning-DimensionalityReductionTechniques

This repository maintains variety of Machine Learning Dimensionality Reduction Techniques.

With this project we able to know the types of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques.

# Description

In this project we explore Dimensionality Reduction Techniques.

1) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

2) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

3) Kernel PCA

4) t-SNE( t-Distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding )

# Algorithms

PCA:
   ----- Linear transformation technique used for dimensionality reduction.
   ----- Reduces n-dimensional space to d-dimensional space where n<d.
   ----- Unsupervised Learning Algorithm because it dont care about dependent variable it only cares about finding the Component Axes.
   
 LDA:
 ----- Similar to PCA with some changes.
 ----- LDA is Supervised Learning Algorithm as it cares about relation with the Dependent variable.
 ----- Inaddition to finding the Component Axes we are interested in axes that maximizes the separation between Multiple Classes.
 ----- Goal of LDA is to project a Feature Space(n-dimensional) onto a small subspace (k-dimensional) where k<n while maintaining the Class Discriminatory information.
                                                                                                                
 t-SNE:
                                                                                                                
  ----- Similar to LDA
  ----- t-SNE tries to preserve Local Structure of data i.e it preserves the Multi Class information.
